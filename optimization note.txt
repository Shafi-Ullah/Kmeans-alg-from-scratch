KMeans Optimization Note

The main problem is that the runtime is extremely high compared to sklearn because of its nested loops and the method(np.dot) used for distance calculation.

np.dot itself is fast because it is implemented in optimized C code.  
However, using np.dot inside Python loops causes slowness due to loop overhead.  
To speed up, use NumPy vectorized operations with broadcasting to avoid Python loops.


1. Problem with loops:
   - Python for-loops are slow, especially nested loops where distances are computed for each data point to every centroid.
   - Example: 1000 points Ã— 7 centroids = 7000 loops, which is time-consuming.

2. Vectorization:
   - NumPy's vectorized operations are highly optimized at the C level.
   - Distances can be computed for all points and centroids simultaneously as a matrix.
   - This eliminates the overhead of Python loops.

3. How vectorization works:
   - Using broadcasting: `X[:, np.newaxis] - centroids[np.newaxis, :]` creates an array of shape (n_samples, n_clusters, n_features).
   - Compute norms/distances along axis=2.
   - Assign clusters for all points at once.

4. Result:
   - The code runs much faster, especially on large datasets.
   - Enables efficient clustering on big data.

5. Other optimizations:
   - Reduce number of iterations (max_iter).
   - Use better initialization methods (k-means++).
   - Handle empty clusters properly.

Summary:  
Replacing Python loops with NumPy vectorized math greatly improves speed and efficiency of KMeans implementation.
